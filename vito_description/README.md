I don't care about *vito*, I'm working on the ILIAD robot.  

## ILIAD objects

The ILIAD project has a list of 16 objects, which are saved in the project as:

| Objects               | Dimensions [m]              |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- |
| artsoppa              | D = 0.20 H = 0.25           |

| nyponsoppa            | L = 0.46 H = 0.18 W = 0.15  |
| onos                  | D = 0.22 H = 0.26           |
| pauluns               | L = 0.38 H = 0.18 W = 0.14  |
| potatismos_komplett   | L = 0.38 H = 0.23 W = 0.20  |
| senap                 | D = 0.20 H = 0.13           |
| sosstark_senap        | D = 0.15 H = 0.13           |
| unknown               | D = 0.16 H = 0.18           |

The reference system of each object is centered in the center of mass. The z axis corresponds to the height (H) dimension
of the object, while for the boxes the x axis corresponds to the width (W) and the y axis to the length (L).
